# Face Attendance Marking

This repository contains scripts for face-based attendance marking using either a system camera or an ESP32 web camera. It also includes the necessary requirements and Arduino code for ESP32 setup.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
- Python 3.9 or later
- CMake
- dlib
- OpenCV

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Python Dependencies
First, install the necessary Python libraries from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
cd face_attendance_marking
```
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install CMake
CMake is required for building dlib. You can find `cmake.exe` in the `requirements` folder.
- **Windows:** Run `requirements/cmake.exe` to install CMake.
- **Linux/Mac:** Use your package manager:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install cmake  # For Debian/Ubuntu
  brew install cmake         # For macOS
  ```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install dlib
Make sure to install `dlib` from the provided files to ensure compatibility between your python version:
```bash
pip install "your_compatible_version_file_path"
```

## üì° ESP32 Arduino Setup
Upload the provided `Wificam.ino` to your ESP32 board using Arduino IDE:
1. Select **Board:** ESP32 AI thinker Module.
2. Set the **Upload Speed:** 115200.
3. Configure your **WiFi credentials** in the `.ino` file.
 ```bash
static const char* WIFI_SSID = "your_wifi_user_name";
static const char* WIFI_PASS = "your_wifi_password";
```
6. Upload the code and check the serial monitor for the streaming URL.

## üöÄ Usage
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Using System Camera
Run the script to capture attendance from the system camera:
```bash
python scripts/sys_cam.py
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Using ESP32 Web Camera
Make sure the ESP32 is set up and connected to WiFi. Then replace url value in [link](scripts/esp_32_cam.py) :
```bash
url = 'http://<replace_with_ESP32_IP_Address>:81/stream'
```

## üí° Notes
- Ensure your firewall allows access to the ESP32 camera feed.
- Use the same WiFi network for your ESP32 and the computer running the script.
